**Project Comments**
Inputs read from file datain (hardcoded in source), and outputs written to file a.out by redirect > ./one > a.out.  You can simply run the code by unpacking to a directory, running make, then running ./one.  Programs 2 and three are similar.


**Installation notes**
Just download, make all, and run one, two, and three.
